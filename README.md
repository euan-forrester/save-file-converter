## Emulators with incompatible save formats

- (GBA) Pizza Boy (support for this emulator has been discontinued) files incompatible with mGBA (believe mGBA uses raw files)
- (PS1) Beetle HW incompatible with DuckStation
- (Saturn) SSF incompatible with Mednafen/Beetle Saturn
- (N64) Mupen64Plus Next files incompatible with Wii64
- (32X) Picodrive has its own save format (somewhere around here? https://github.com/notaz/picodrive/blob/1d366b1ad9362fd463c42979c8a687dfc7f46c46/platform/common/emu.c#L873)

  - https://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?p=137153&sid=37bd385d91e7c2d89cf1ff8d70e8c640#p137153 Discussion saying that you need to either use a plugin, or parse the executable for look for code around a certain system call to figure out what value is being passed to it
  - I can't seem to find an online list of game keys, and requiring users to install a plugin on their PSP then type a gamekey into the interface seems like too much to ask.

    - https://github.com/euan-forrester/psp-encryption-webassembly Copy of the relevant code in PPSSPP, compiled into webassembly
  - For Gran Turismo the game key is device-specific. Must be generated somehow from a device ID. So can't find it in the executable.
    - So we still need a box to enter the game key instead of just ISO/eboot
    - Maybe detect this ISO and warn the user?
- NES/SNES Classic save game format

  - http://darkakuma.z-net.us/p/sfromtool.html (convert SNES ROMs and/or saves to the SNES Classic ROM and/or save format)
  - I'm not sure there's enough demand for a web-based tool that does this. The devices aren't available for sale anymore and you already have to run a Windows program to transfer the games. Also the Windows tool for the SNES Classic has the ability to convert saves already.

- Online emulators
  - `.ggz` files when unzipped apparently contain one or more pairs of `.gba`/`.snes`/etc and `.png` file: a save state and a thumbnail
  - There's a port of Retroarch available online here: https://binbashbanana.github.io/webretro/ with code here: https://github.com/BinBashBanana/webretro . Its save file compatibility is the same as regular Retroarch and the emulators therein
- Retroarch
  - Some save files are compressed with ZLIB compression. I'm not sure the circumstances under which this happens: https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/14031#issuecomment-1159400581

## Cart reader notes
 
- Retrode2
  - Genesis: SRAM/FRAM saves are byte expanded by doubling: "HELLO" becomes "HHEELLLLOO" rather than " H E L L O" like in many emulators/flash carts
- Retroblaster
  - Same as Retrode2

## Real-Time Clock save format
- https://bgb.bircd.org/rtcsave.html

Some platforms (e.g. some MiSTer cores) append RTC data to the end of a save file. The above link describes a common format for RTC data.

## Offline use

Occassionally there's a need to use the tool offline, such as when you'll be without an Internet connection for an extended period. There's 2 methods to achieve this:

### Method 1: Use a website saving tool

You can't just right click on the page and select Save As... because the site is divided internally into many different files, and that will only download some of them.

Google `website saving tool` or something similar to find an up-to-date list of such tools.

### Method 2: Build it locally (for people comfortable with the command line and development tools)

You may need to modify some of these steps depending on your development environment, but this should give you the general idea.

#### MacOS/Linux

Install `homebrew`: https://brew.sh/

```
brew install yarn
brew install git
```
Then proceed to the [Common](https://github.com/euan-forrester/save-file-converter#common) section

#### Windows

Find an equivalent package manager to `homebrew`, and use it to install `git` and `yarn` (or install them and their dependencies manually: `git`: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git, `yarn`: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Then proceed to the [Common](https://github.com/euan-forrester/save-file-converter#common) section

#### Common

```
git clone git@github.com:euan-forrester/save-file-converter.git
cd save-file-converter/frontend
yarn install
yarn serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Note that you'll have to keep the command line window open with `yarn serve` running for as long as you want to access the site.

## Internet archive

If you need to, you can also access the site via the Internet archive here: https://web.archive.org/web/https://savefileconverter.com/
