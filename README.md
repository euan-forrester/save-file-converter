## Upcoming features

- Decrypt PSP saves
- Reorganize the interface to be listed by game console rather than save file format
- Be able to autodetect the format of a given save file (note that raw files need their size checked, unrecognized size means invalid file)
- I need suggestions!

  - I can't seem to find an online list of game keys, and requiring users to install a plugin on their PSP then type a gamekey into the interface seems like too much to ask.

  - I'm not sure there's enough demand for a web-based tool that does this. The devices aren't available for sale anymore and you already have to run a Windows program to transfer the games. Also the Windows tool for the SNES Classic has the ability to convert saves already.

## Deployment instructions

### Backend setup: AWS and terraform

First we need to create the infrastructure that the system will run on

#### Install packages

```
brew install terraform
```

#### Create an AWS account

Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and click on "Create an AWS Account"

Then create an IAM user within that account. This user will need to have various permissions to create different kinds of infrastructure.

Copy the file `terraform/aws_credentials.example` to `terraform/aws_credentials`
- Copy the new user's AWS key and secret key into the new file you just created.

#### Run terraform

Note that this will create infrastructure within your AWS account and could result in billing charges from AWS

Note: Run terraform with the environment variable `TF_LOG=1` to help debug permissions issues.

For convenience we will create a symlink to our `terraform.tfvars` file. You can also import these variables from the command line when you run terraform if you prefer.

In your `terraform.tfvars` file, fill in the various parts. If you choose to create a domain, do so manually in the AWS console then put the domain name and Route 53 Zone ID created by Route 53 into this file.

```
cd terraform/dev
ln -s ../terraform.tfvars terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
### Frontend setup

#### Install packages

```
cd ../../frontend
brew install yarn
yarn install
```

#### Optional project dashboard

```
yarn global add @vue/cli
vue ui
```

Then go to: http://localhost:8000/dashboard

#### Deploy the frontend

Edit the bucket names in `frontend/vue.config.js` and `frontend/.env.production` to be the website s3 bucket(s) created by terraform if necessary. Similarly for the CloudFront IDs.

```
yarn build --mode development
yarn deploy --mode development
```
and for production:
```
yarn build --mode production
yarn deploy --mode production
yarn deploy:cleanup --mode production
```

Go into S3 to get the domain for your bucket. 

Point your browser there and enjoy!
