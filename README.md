# Save File Converter

Web-based tool to convert save files from retro game consoles to different formats

![Save file conversion](https://github.com/euan-forrester/save-file-converter/raw/main/images/main-window.png "Save file conversion")

Available at https://savefileconverter.com

## Upcoming features

- Be able to autodetect the format of a given save file (note that raw files need their size checked, unrecognized size means invalid file)
- PS2 formats (check out https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/536777-suikoden-iii/saves for a potential list)
- GameCube formats (check out https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/533008-soulcalibur-ii/saves for a potential list)
- Saturn formats
  - Add ability to add/extract a single game's save to/from a RAM backup, similar to how PS1/N64 work
- What are the 64kB `.srm` files for SNES etc on thetechgame.com? Want to extract a 'normal' `.srm` file from them
- I need suggestions!

## Usecases for further thought

- Automatically add/remove header added by some flash carts (e.g. EZ Flash) given an example file
- Be able to change the size of a raw GBA save to help move between emulators

## Emulators with incompatible save formats

- (GBA) Pizza Boy GBA files incompatible with mGBA (believe mGBA uses raw files)
- (PS1) Beetle HW incompatible with DuckStation
- (Saturn) SSF incompatible with Mednafen/Beetle Saturn
- (N64) Mupen64Plus Next files incompatible with Wii64
- (32X) Picodrive has its own save format (somewhere around here? https://github.com/notaz/picodrive/blob/1d366b1ad9362fd463c42979c8a687dfc7f46c46/platform/common/emu.c#L873)

## Other feature ideas

- Convert to Wii VC
- Convert to/from Wii U VC
- Convert to/from 3DS VC
- Split/recombine Sega CD save files
- Split/recombine GBA emulator save files (Goomba/PocketNES/SmsAdvance)

  - I can't seem to find an online list of game keys, and requiring users to install a plugin on their PSP then type a gamekey into the interface seems like too much to ask.

  - I'm not sure there's enough demand for a web-based tool that does this. The devices aren't available for sale anymore and you already have to run a Windows program to transfer the games. Also the Windows tool for the SNES Classic has the ability to convert saves already.

## Real-Time Clock save format
- https://bgb.bircd.org/rtcsave.html

Some platforms (e.g. some MiSTer cores) append RTC data to the end of a save file. The above link describes a common format for RTC data.

## Offline use

Occassionally there's a need to use the tool offline, such as when you'll be without an Internet connection for an extended period. There's 2 methods to achieve this:

### Method 1: Use a website saving tool

You can't just right click on the page and select Save As... because the site is divided internally into many different files, and that will only download some of them.

Google `website saving tool` or something similar to find an up-to-date list of such tools.

### Method 2: Build it locally (for people comfortable with the command line and development tools)

You may need to modify some of these steps depending on your development environment, but this should give you the general idea.

#### MacOS/Linux

Install `homebrew`: https://brew.sh/

```
brew install yarn
brew install git
```
Then proceed to the [Common](https://github.com/euan-forrester/save-file-converter#common) section

#### Windows

Find an equivalent package manager to `homebrew`, and use it to install `git` and `yarn` (or install them and their dependencies manually: `git`: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git, `yarn`: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Then proceed to the [Common](https://github.com/euan-forrester/save-file-converter#common) section

#### Common

```
git clone git@github.com:euan-forrester/save-file-converter.git
cd save-file-converter/frontend
yarn install
yarn serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Note that you'll have to keep the command line window open with `yarn serve` running for as long as you want to access the site.
