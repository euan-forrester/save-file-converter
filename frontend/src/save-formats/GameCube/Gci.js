The standard format for individual saves on the GameCube appears to be the .GCI format.

There are other potential formats recognized by Dolphin:
- .GCS: https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Source/Core/Core/HW/GCMemcard/GCMemcardUtils.cpp#L149
- .SAV: https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Source/Core/Core/HW/GCMemcard/GCMemcardUtils.cpp#L182

Dolphin distinguishes between them based on file size, because the blocks are the same but the header is different: https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Source/Core/Core/HW/GCMemcard/GCMemcardUtils.cpp#L212

.GCI is a directory entry concatenated with the raw save data

Note that the starting block number in the directory entry is irrelevant here

0x00-0x3F: Directory entry
0x40-EOF:  Game data (including the comment and icons)

// Figuring out the encoding of the comments is tricky. In a real save file the encoding is specified in the header.
// However, this user-defined format takes the directory entry from the real format but omits the header.

// It does not appear that we can automatically detect the encoding of the comments.
// The encoding-japanese package that we use to encode/decode shift-jis strings can in theory
// detect encoding, but for our example save files it returns "UTF32" for US-ASCII comments,
// and any one of "UTF32", "UTF16", or "SJIS" for the Japanese ones (which are all in shift-jis)

// We could parse them always using shift-jis because the ASCII stuff will be decoded correctly, with the exception of backslash and tilde and then anything in "extended" ASCII above 0x7F

// But we can maybe do slightly better by trying to infer the encoding from the region of the game.
// Games from the Japan region we'll decode as shift-jis, and the other 2 regions (North American and Europe) we'll decode as US-ASCII
