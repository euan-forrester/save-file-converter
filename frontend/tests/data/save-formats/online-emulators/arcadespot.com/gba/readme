== Notes

Not sure which emulator this uses. It appears to put the name of the ROM first in the save state.

It may be the VBA-next emulator: https://github.com/libretro/vba-next/blob/master/src/gba.cpp#L8820

It matches having the ROM internal name at the start of the file, and having the different types of save data at consistent offsets.

I tried making a save state using mGBA on my home machine, and it didn't contain the in-game save data.

My tenuous belief that it's VBA-next comes from this: https://github.com/liriliri/luna/blob/master/src/retro-emulator/story.js#L20

And my tenuous belief that that package is relevant is because the sites I looked at seem to get their emulation from retroemulator.com (which in turn appears to get its ROMs from playroms.net)

== In-game save data offsets

512B EEPROM

Save data in the Donkey Kong country 2 example file begins at offset 0x90DEC

8kB EEPROM

Save data in the Zelda: Minish Cap example file begins at offset 0x90DEC

32kB SRAM

Save data in the Metroid: Zero Mission example file begins at offset 0x93010
Save data in the Metroid: Fusion example file begins at offset 0x93010

64kB Flash RAM

Save data in the Golden Sun example file seems to begin at offset 0x90010, but it works if we take data from 0x93010 instead
Save data in the Advance Wars example file begins at offset 0x93010

128kB Flash RAM

Save data in the Pokemon: Sapphire example file begins at offset 0x93010
Save data in the Super Mario Advance 4 example file begins at offset 0x93010
